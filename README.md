# Multi AI Agents Examples

This repository contains practical and educational examples of using **multiple AI agents** working together to complete tasks. These examples are built using frameworks like **CrewAI** and focus on solving real-world problems through automation and collaboration between agents.

## 🔍 Overview

The goal of this repository is to:

- Demonstrate real-world use cases of multi-agent AI systems.
- Provide well-documented Jupyter Notebooks for learning and hands-on practice.
- Showcase how to use local or free LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek, Gemini) without paid APIs.
- Explore how AI agents can take roles like reading, summarizing, analyzing, recommending, and communicating.

## 🧠 Example Projects

1. **Contract Review Workflow**
   - Contract Reader: Extracts text using OCR and summarizes.
   - Risk Assessor: Detects clauses that might pose legal or compliance risks.
   - Recommendation Agent: Suggests edits based on internal policy.
   - Email Agent: Sends a compiled report to the client automatically.

> More examples will be added frequently — covering business workflows, document analysis, report generation, and content pipelines.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Multi-AI-Agents-Examples.git
   cd Multi-AI-Agents-Examples
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks and run step-by-step cells to see how each multi-agent system works.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- CrewAI
- Local LLM interface (e.g., Ollama, llama-cpp)
- OCR library (e.g., pytesseract)
- Langchain (optional for memory/tools)

## 👥 Who This Is For

- Learners exploring GenAI, Langchain, and agentic workflows
- Freelancers automating document or client tasks
- Developers building task-oriented agent pipelines
